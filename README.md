# Python-PDF-Merger
Python PDF merger for windows

I created this script to merge PDF files but I needed to be able to open them from multiple locations on my PC and save the merged file to multiple locations on my PC.

Library Requirements:
os
Tkinter
filedialog (tkinter)
PdfFileMerger (PyPDF2)

Usage:
1. Asks for the directory your PDF are located.
2. Merges them.
3. Asks where you'd like to save the merged file.
