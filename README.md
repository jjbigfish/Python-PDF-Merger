I created this simple script to merge PDF files with the ability open and save them from/to multiple locations on my PC.
  
  
<b>Library Requirements:</b>  
os  
Tkinter  
filedialog (tkinter)  
PdfFileMerger (PyPDF2)  
  
  
<b>Usage:</b>  
1. Asks for the directory your PDF are located.
2. Merges them.
3. Asks where you'd like to save the merged file.
